## Traffic Mirroring

1.Differences between SPAN and TAP:

SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer): Operates at the switch level, copying traffic from one or more ports to a designated monitoring port.
TAP (Test Access Point): Physically duplicates network traffic, providing a complete copy to a monitoring tool, without impacting the network.

2.Network Devices Supporting Traffic Mirroring:

Routers, switches, and network appliances with mirroring capabilities can support network traffic mirroring.

3.Network Traffic Mirroring for Security:

Used to monitor and analyze network activity in real-time, aiding in the detection of suspicious behavior, intrusion attempts, and potential security threats.

4.Legal or Ethical Considerations:

Legal and ethical considerations involve respecting privacy laws, ensuring user consent, and safeguarding sensitive information when implementing network traffic mirroring.
