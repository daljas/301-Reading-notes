## Active Directory

1.What exactly is “Active Directory” and are the key services it provides?

Active Directory is a Microsoft service for managing and organizing information in Windows networks. It offers key services such as authentication, authorization, directory organization, policy management, and a global catalog.

2.What are the differences between a domain, forest, and tree in Active Directory?

Domain: Represents a group of network resources with a common namespace and security policies.

Forest: Collection of domains sharing a common schema and global catalog.

Tree: Hierarchical arrangement of domains within a forest, sharing schema and configuration.

3. How can objects (e.g., users, devices) within a domain be grouped?

Objects in a domain can be grouped using containers and organizational units (OUs), facilitating logical organization and delegated administrative tasks.

4.Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member.

Active Directory is like a digital organizer for our network. It manages users and devices, controlling access and applying rules uniformly. Think of it as a master key for our digital world, ensuring security and smooth organization.
